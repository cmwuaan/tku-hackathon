## Implementation process

### STEP 1: Task Analysis

- Read the file task description provided by Product Owner
- Checkout the Figma file and read the node data
- If task is not clear, ask for clarification
- If dependencies task is not completed, ask for clarification
- Review similar implementations in codebase
- Identify reusable patterns and components
- List potential technical challenges
- Document assumptions and questions

### STEP 2: Confirm current context

- If Change Type is one of Enhancement, Integration, Refactoring, you must investigate current code that relate task description
  - Understand impact of change
  - Understand scope of change
  - Don't change current code if no needed
- Read the file: [coding-instruction.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/coding-instruction.mdc)
  - Understand project structure
  - Understand code conventions
  - Read more documents related to task description
- Investigate existing components to understand code style

### STEP 3: Implementation

1. Create component
2. Run project to test component without API
3. Integrate component with API
4. Run project and fix errors

Note:

- If this task is complex or high risk or integration-heavy, perform Dependency Analysis and Planning first. Put the analysis files in `docs/tasks/<task-name>`.

### STEP 5: Quality Checks

- Run linter and fix issues
- Compare code with Figma design
- Review code against style guide

### STEP 6: Keep documentation updated

- Update task status `docs/tasks/<task-name>/status.md`
- Update `docs/tasks/<task-name>/plan.md` if needed
