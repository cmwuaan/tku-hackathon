# Step 1: Create task & extract Figma design specifications

Hi Product Owner,

Please create a task for implementing this Figma component:
<figma-url> (e.g., [https://tku-hackathon-vibecoder.figma.site/](https://tku-hackathon-vibecoder.figma.site/))

The development should be split into 2 steps:

1. Extract design specifications following @figma-mcp.mdc guidelines

   - Once step 1 is finished, let's attach documents to step 2

2. Implement the component based on:
   - The plan created in step 1
   - @implementation-process.mdc guidelines

Important reminders for developers:

- Review Figma design carefully before creating atomic components.
- Ensure accessibility standards (contrast, touch targets) are met.
- Follow the project folder structure.

Start step 1.

# Step 2: Create UI follow folder structure

Hi developer,

Please implement the <component-name> component according to the giving plan. Follow these guidelines:

- Follow the @implementation-process.mdc guidelines.
- Match the Figma design pixel-perfectly, especially the alert color zones (Red/Yellow/Green).

Check unsigned component:

- Make it match the image exactly.
- Use figma-soundwatcher to verify design specs (colors, spacing, typography).

The current layout does not match the design.
I have attached a screenshot for reference.
Please use the figma-soundwatcher MCP to verify the design specifications as needed.
