# What is Sound Watcher?

Sound Watcher is a mobile accessibility application designed to assist deaf individuals, the hard-of-hearing, and deep sleepers by acting as a "digital ear." It utilizes Multimodal AI to continuously monitor the environment and translate audio signals into immediate visual and haptic feedback.

Key features of the application include:

- Real-time Listening: Continuous decibel monitoring (with privacy-focused buffering) to detect sudden noise spikes.
- AI Sound Recognition: Identifies specific acoustic events (e.g., Fire Alarms, Baby Crying, Glass Breaking) using advanced AI analysis.
- Multi-Sensory Alerts: Converts sounds into distinct Vibration patterns, Strobe Flash sequences, and Screen Color overlays based on urgency.
- Safety Zones: Automatically categorizes sounds into urgency levels: Information, Caution, and Danger.
- Event History: Logs all detected events with timestamps and confidence scores for user review.
- The platform is designed for mobile devices (iOS and Android) with a focus on low latency (< 5 seconds), battery optimization, and high reliability for emergency situations.
